This is a framework to run a set of LOCKSS services (a cluster) in a
development environment.  It's a work in progress; details are likely to
change.

Each service to be run must be locally built from source.  To run a minimal
cluster (config service, repository service, and poller/crawler service),
git clone laaws-configservice, laaws-repository-service, and laaws-poller
into sibling dirs of this project, mvn package each one, cd to this dir and
run "./start".  Additional services can be added by editing config/services
or by pointing to a different services file.  Run ./start -h for options.

There are a number of rough edges.  E.g., the actual collected content is
stored within the runcluster tree, but various databases and config files
still reside in service project trees.
